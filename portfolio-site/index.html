            Add your "about me" summary here. Add more paragraphs or links as
            needed. Here is some dummy text: Jozey Nguyen is a
            Vietnamese-American female artist located in the Bay Area. She is
            aiming for her Bachelor in Fine Arts at San Jose State University
            with a major in Digital Media Arts and a minor in Architectural
            Studies. Studying at this university allowed her to experience and
            learn the diversity of mediums in media and art—her passion in
            photography, digital art, and fantasy. Artist Statement I work in
            digital art and photography where I bring out different perspectives
            of life. My favorite genre is fantasy because, in a world like ours,
            taking myself away from reality is a deal-breaker once in a while. I
            like to imagine myself in a different world where I can breathe with
            creativity and passion. The audience that I want to introduce my
            artwork to is anyone as I try to bring my imagination to life
            through art. There is a variety of mediums that I have used which
            you can see in my portfolio, I mainly want to focus on photography,
            photoshop, illustrator, blender, and video editing. Taking certain
            things from reality and transforming them into something new,
            different, and compelling will reintroduce the audience to a
            meaningful experience.
